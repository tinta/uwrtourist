            p.text-thin Underwater rugby is a fun, fast-paced breath hold sport that is played with mask, snorkel, fins, a negatively bouyant ball, and 2 baskets, one at either end of a 6-10 foot deep section of pool. It's kind of a fun mix of free diving, polo and wrestling, but played entirely underwater!
